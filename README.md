## Description

This project, developed as part of "The Odin Project" JavaScript course, is a web application that allows users to manage their personal library collection. Users can easily add new books to their library, specify details such as the title, author, and number of pages, and mark whether they have read the book or not. Additionally, users can remove books from their library and toggle the read status of existing books. 📖
